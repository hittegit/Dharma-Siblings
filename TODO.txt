Welcome to the madness! Notes, thoughts, stuff that needs doing:

More CI?

Restructure

Repo cleanup: sub-directories for markdown files?

Additional categories in the navbar? Expanded categories?

Embed the rest of the videos (embed organization?)

release tags, changelog reqs, protected branch, etc
