Welcome to the madness! Notes, thoughts, stuff that needs doing:

More CI?

Restructure

Repo cleanup: sub-directories for markdown files?

Additional categories in the navbar? Expanded categories?

Embed the rest of the videos (embed organization?)

release tags, changelog reqs, protected branch, etc

Broken links by page (format: description of URL: URL)

## pages/video-and-film.md
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring
Zen (2009)
Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East
The Mountain Path - Ed Burger link needs to be added

AFTER FIXING THESE LINKS:
    Find alternatives to Amazon listings, preferring publisher listings
