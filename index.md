title: Dharma Siblings Group Compass
---

🙏 *Welcome to our informal online sangha.* This space exists to help us stay connected outside the zendo—through sharing books, articles, poetry, art, Dharma talks, practice questions, and light conversation.

Our shared intention is to foster a space of mutual respect, warmth, and sincerity, grounded in our Zen practice. This compass offers a simple framework to help us care for that space together.

---

## We Will:
- Uphold the [Houston Zen Center community guidelines](https://houstonzen.org/ethical-guidelines-and-procedures).
- Speak from personal experience, practicing **Right Speech**:  
  Is it *true*, *timely*, *gentle*, *beneficial*, and spoken with a mind of goodwill?
- Keep the focus on practice: sharing inspiration, inquiry, and reflection—not instruction or correction.
- Be receptive to the unfolding of the Dharma in one another's lives.

---

## We Won’t:
- Assume this space is private.  
  *If you wish to share something sensitive or deeply personal, please do so in a private conversation or in person, where deeper trust can be established.*
- Rely on this space for therapeutic support, crisis processing, or end-of-life contemplation.  
  *When deep personal suffering or medical needs arise, it’s wise and compassionate to turn to trusted teachers or qualified professionals who are prepared to help.*
- Share claims of enlightenment, kensho, or extraordinary experiences in the group; these are better explored in one-on-one conversations with teachers.
- Circulate conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, or politicized content unrelated to our shared practice.
- Disrupt the group’s tone or purpose through frequent off-topic, inflammatory, or unkind posts.

## A Living Container

This is a collaborative space. The compass is here to **guide**, not to **police**, and may evolve as we grow.

Thank you for helping care for this container.  
**Your presence matters.**

**Warm bows,**  
*The Dharma Siblings* 🙏
