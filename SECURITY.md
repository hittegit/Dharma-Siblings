# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue.

Report vulnerabilities privately by contacting the maintainer directly through GitHub:

- Open a private security advisory in this repository, if enabled.
- Or contact `@hittegit` with clear reproduction steps and impact details.

Please include:

- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected files or pages
- Any suggested remediation

We will review reports as quickly as possible and coordinate responsible disclosure.
